,," Hey Doctor, can you tell me what's on my face?","With what I see, I think you have acne on your face, which appears to be moderate to severe with multiple red bumps and pimples, and one large inflamed lesion on your lower lip area. I would suggest using a gentle cleanser and topical creams or gels containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide to help control the acne, and possibly oral antibiotics if the condition is severe, and I would also advise you to maintain good skin hygiene and avoid picking or squeezing the pimples to prevent scarring.",.gradio\flagged\Doctors Response Audio\1b2915dd9a5d55830173\final.mp3,2025-05-14 13:15:00.673899
